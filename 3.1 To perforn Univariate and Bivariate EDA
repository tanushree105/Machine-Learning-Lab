A] To perform Univariate EDA

EDA (EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS) : To understand the data

Data Analysis means asking yourself the questions regarding the data

One-variate : A variable is realted to another one variable

Univariate EDA : It shows relationship between 2 variables

TRAIN DATASET

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/AIML Lab/train.csv'

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

#1. What is the size of data
df.shape

#2. How does the data looks like ?
df.head()

#3. What is the datatype of the columns ?
df.info()

#4.Are there any missing values?
df.isnull()

df.isnull().sum() #each attributes have this many NULL values

#5.Is there any duplicate values ?

df.duplicated().sum()

#6. Is there any corelation ?
df.corr(numeric_only = True) #Any attribute is connected with (or related to) another attribute

Date = 25/08/25

df.corr(numeric_only = True)['Survived'] #Calculates the correlation between the "Survived" column
                                          #and all other numeric columns in the DataFrame df.

df.corr(numeric_only = True)['Pclass'] #calculates the correlation between the "Pclass" column
                                       #and all other numeric columns in the DataFrame df.

df.corr(numeric_only = True)["Age"] #calculates the correlation between the "Age" column
                                    #and all other numeric columns in the DataFrame df

#**SEABORN MODULE**

It has inbuilt dataset and has multiple visualisation and graphs like plots, etc ,matplot lib has all plots, graphs

import seaborn as sns

sns.catplot(df["Pclass"]) #creates a categorical plot of the "Pclass" column from df, showing its distribution.

sns.catplot(df["Age"]) #creates a catplot of "Age", showing its distribution

sns.catplot(df["Survived"]) #creates a catplot showing its discription

sns.boxplot(df["Survived"]) #creates a box plot of the "Survived" from df, showing the distribution, median, and outliers of the Survived values

sns.boxplot(df["Pclass"]) #creates a box plot of the "Pclass" from df, showing the distribution, median, and outliers of the Survived values

sns.boxplot(df['Age']) #creates a box plot of the "Age" from df, showing the distribution, median, and outliers of the Survived values

sns.scatterplot(x="Survived",y="Pclass",data = df) #creates a scatter plot that shows the relationship
                                                   # between the "Survived" and "Pclass" columns
