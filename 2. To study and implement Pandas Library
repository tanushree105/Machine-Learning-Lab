from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('pokemon_data.csv') #reads the file and loads it into a pandas dataframe df
df

print(df.columns) #reading headers (column names)

print(df.head(3)) #reading starting 3 rows(By default : it gives 5 rows of starting)

print(df["Name"]) #This line prints the "Name" column from a pandas DataFrame df

print(df["Name"][0:10]) #First 10 rows of the specific column using slicing

df.Name  #Simply the name of the columns

print(df[["Name","Type 1","HP"]]) #it’s extracting and printing just
                                  #the Name, Type 1, and HP columns from your DataFrame.

print(df.iloc[1]) #prints the entire second row of the DataFrame df (index 1) as a Series.

print(df.iloc[2,1]) #prints the value in the third row (index 2)
                     #and the second column (index 1) of the DataFrame df.

The 3rd way via uploading file into drive and then mounting the drive for getting the file in colab

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/AIML Lab/pokemon_data.csv'


import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(file_path) #dataframe is the reference to the file

df


**Reading Data in Pandas**

#reading headers
print(df.columns)

print(df.head) #default head method will output the first 5 rows of the DataFrame df.

print(df.head(3)) #1st three rows of each column

print(df['Name']) #prints the values of the "Name" column from the DataFrame df.

print(df['Name'][0:10]) #prints the values of the "Name" column from the first row (index 0)
                         #to the 10th row (index 9) of the DataFrame df.

df.Name  #is a shorthand way of accessing the "Name" column in the DataFrame df

print(df[["Name", "Type 1", "HP"]]) #print 3 column details

print(df.iloc[1])  #Read each row

print(df.shape) #Total number of (rows, column)

print(df.info) #provides all the info regarding the dataset

print(df.describe())  #This provides all the stats like mean, standard deviation etc

df.sort_values("Name") #sorts the DataFrame df in ascending order based on the values in the "Name" column.

df.sort_values("Name",ascending = False) #sorts the DataFrame df in descending order
                                         #based on the values in the "Name" column.

print(df.sort_values(["Type 1","HP"],ascending = False)) #sorts the DataFrame df first by the "Type 1" column
                                                         #and then by the "HP" column, both in descending order.

print(df.sort_values(["Type 1","HP"],ascending = [1,0])) #sorts the DataFrame df by the "Type 1" column in ascending order
